PICMI


General Information
-------------------

Picmi has the following dependencies:

At compile time:
qt, boost, cmake

At run time:
qt


The default installation directories are

$prefix/share/picmi        (graphics)
$prefix/bin                (executable)
$prefix/share/applications (.desktop file)
~/.config/picmi/           (user configurations and highscores, created at runtime)

$prefix can be configured by setting the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable when running cmake and defaults to /usr/local/ if not set.


Installation from AUR (Archlinux)
-------------------

Install using your favorite AUR helper or manually with wget && makepkg && pacman -U.

Manual Installation
-------------------

In the picmi directory containing CMakeLists.txt, execute:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr" .
make
make install

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX can be set as required.
This will install to the default directories as specified above. For packaging,

make DESTDIR="/your/packaging/dir" install

will install to /your/packaging/dir.

All done, execute picmi to run the game.



Cross Platform Compatibility
----------------------------

Picmi should be compatible with any platform supported by Qt and boost. At the
very least, this means Linux, Mac and Windows installs should work just fine.

To install on another platform than Linux, edit CMakeLists.txt and set picmi_FILEPATH
to a location appropriate to your platform.

Settings and high scores will be automatically saved to platform-dependent locations;
for more details, see the QSettings documentation.


Enjoy!
